# Repository of weights in stable diffusion model

This repository contains the weights for three models.
* CLIP: the weights are placed under `model_weights/clip/`, named as `clip_{i}.pkl`, where `i` is 0-based integer index.
* UNet: the weights are placed under `model_weights/unet/`, named as `unet_{i}.pkl`.
* VAE: the weights are placed under `model_weights/vae/`, named as `vae_{i}.pkl`.
